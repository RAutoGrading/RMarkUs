**RMarkUs** is an R package designed to streamline the grading process
of R Markdown assignments (.qmd & .rmd) by integrating with the
[**MarkUs**](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus) online grading
platform. Built on top of the popular
[`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package, **RMarkUs** provides
a robust and flexible framework for automatic grading, enabling
educators to efficiently evaluate studentsâ€™ code, analyses, and reports
directly within their R Markdown submissions.

**Key Features:**

- **Seamless Integration with MarkUs**: Automatically fetch, grade, and
  upload grades for R Markdown assignments submitted to
  [**MarkUs**](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus), eliminating
  manual grading tasks and saving time for educators.
- **Test-Driven Grading**: Leverages `testthat` to define grading
  criteria as test cases, allowing for customizable, reproducible, and
  transparent grading.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to handle large courses with
  hundreds of students, **RMarkUs** automates the entire grading
  pipeline, ensuring consistency and fairness across all submissions.

**Who Should Use RMarkUs?**

**RMarkUs** is a project initiated by educators at the Department of
Statistical Sciences in the University of Toronto. **RMarkUs** is ideal
for educators, teaching assistants, and course administrators who manage
large programming courses and want to automate the grading of
assignments submitted through
[**MarkUs**](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus).
